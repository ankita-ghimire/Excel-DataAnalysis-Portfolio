# Excel Project: Dynamic Product Sales Calculator with Excel Tables

**Project Status:** Completed

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate a comprehensive mastery of Excel Tables as the foundation for building robust, scalable, and automated analytical reports. The project involved a real-world scenario of merging data from two separate sources (sales transactions and product information) into a single, dynamic reporting table that automatically calculates key performance indicators like `TotalRevenue` and `Profit`.

This project proves that using Excel Tables is not just a formatting choice, but a strategic approach to data analysis that ensures data integrity, improves formula readability, and automates calculations.

## Skills and Tools Demonstrated

This project is a deep dive into the features and benefits of using formal Excel Tables:

*   **Table Creation & Management:**
    *   Correctly converting raw data ranges into named Excel Tables (`tblSales`, `tblProducts`).
    *   Demonstrated knowledge of how to add new columns and have the table range expand automatically.
    *   Applied professional **Table Styles** for enhanced readability and presentation.
    *   Utilized the automated **Total Row** feature for quick and dynamic summarization (Sum, Average, etc.).
    *   Showcased how to **Convert a Table back to a Range**, a key skill for exporting data or for specific formatting needs.

*   **Structured Referencing (The Core Skill):**
    *   **Formulas:** Mastered the use of modern, readable **Structured References** instead of traditional cell references (e.g., `=[@UnitsSold]*[@UnitPrice]`). This is a critical skill for building error-resistant and easily understandable formulas.
    *   **Data Merging:** Used `XLOOKUP` with structured references (`=[@ProductID],tblProducts[ProductID],...`) to efficiently and accurately merge data from a separate lookup table (`tblProducts`) into the main report table (`tblReport`).

*   **Data Analysis & Visualization:**
    *   **Table as a Source:** Demonstrated the best practice of using a named Excel Table as the direct, dynamic source for a **PivotTable**. This ensures that the analysis automatically includes any new data added to the source table upon refreshing.
    *   **Quick Analysis Tools:** Used built-in features like **Data Bars** to quickly add a layer of visual analysis directly within the table structure.

## Key Project Steps

1.  **Data Setup:** Two distinct datasets (Sales Transactions and Product Information) were imported and converted into two separate, named Excel Tables: `tblSales` and `tblProducts`.
2.  **Table Merging:** A main report table, `tblReport`, was created. The `XLOOKUP` function, powered by structured references, was used to pull `ProductName`, `Category`, `UnitPrice`, and `UnitCost` from `tblProducts` into `tblReport`, creating a single, enriched dataset.
3.  **Dynamic Calculations:** New columns were added to `tblReport` to calculate `TotalRevenue` and `Profit`. These calculations were written using structured references, which automatically propagated down the entire column.
4.  **Summarization & Formatting:** The built-in **Total Row** was activated to automatically sum the `TotalRevenue` and `Profit` columns. A professional **Table Style** and visual **Data Bars** were applied to enhance the report's clarity.
5.  **Final Analysis:** A **PivotTable** was created directly from the `tblReport`, proving its utility as a reliable data source for further analysis. The PivotTable summarized total profit by product category.
6.  **Final Demonstration:** A copy of the final table was converted back to a simple range to demonstrate full knowledge of Table features.

## Why Use Excel Tables? (Project Insights)

This project concretely demonstrates why using formal Tables is a superior method for data analysis in Excel:
*   **Automation:** Formulas and formatting automatically fill down to new rows, saving time and eliminating "copy-paste" errors.
*   **Readability:** Structured references make formulas like `=[@UnitsSold]*[@UnitPrice]` far more intuitive and easier to debug than `G2*I2`.
*   **Scalability:** When new sales data is added to the source tables, the entire report—from the `XLOOKUP` formulas to the final PivotTable—can be updated with a single click of the "Refresh" button. The system is built to grow.
*   **Integrity:** By using table and column names, the formulas are less likely to break if columns or rows are moved, ensuring the report remains robust.
