# Excel Data Analysis Project â€” Filtering & Conditional Formatting

Overview
This project demonstrates core **Excel data analysis techniques** using a sample employee sales dataset.  
It covers multiple ways of filtering, sorting, and visualizing data using Excel features.  
The purpose is to practice skills that are directly applicable in data analyst internships and real-world tasks.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- File: `Filtering_CF_Project.xlsx`
- RawData columns:
  - EmpID  
  - FirstName  
  - LastName  
  - Department  
  - Country  
  - Quarter  
  - Priority  
  - Sales  
  - Status  
  - JoinDate  

The dataset contains mock employee sales data across departments, priorities, and time periods.

## Project Structure
The Excel workbook has multiple sheets, each demonstrating a specific concept:

1. RawData â€” Clean dataset (untouched, base for analysis).  
2. AutoFilter â€” Filtering by text, number, and dates.  
3. FilterByColor â€” Filter based on cell and font colors.  
4. AdvancedFilter â€” Using criteria ranges and extracting unique values.  
5. DynamicFilter â€” Using Excel 365 `FILTER` formula for live dynamic views.  
6. ConditionalFormatting â€” Data bars, color scales, icon sets, duplicates, alternate row shading.  
7. PivotTable â€” Top N analysis (Top 5 employees by Sales).

---

## Features Demonstrated
- AutoFilter by multiple criteria (e.g., Department = Sales, Country = USA).  
- Advanced Filter for programmatic filtering and unique record extraction.  
- Dynamic filtering with modern Excel 365 formulas (`FILTER`, `SORT`).  
- Conditional formatting for:
  - Heatmaps  
  - Icon sets  
  - Duplicate detection  
  - Alternate row shading  
- PivotTable analysis for Top 5 Employees by Sales.
