# Excel Project: What-If Analysis for Business Scenarios

 **Scope:** Minor Project


## Project Objective

The objective of this project was to utilize Excel's core What-If Analysis tools to perform strategic planning for a new product launch. By building a dynamic financial model, this project showcases how to use **Goal Seek** to determine a critical business metric (the break-even point) and how to use **Scenario Manager** to compare the potential profitability of several distinct business strategies.

This project demonstrates a strong capability in foundational financial modeling and the use of Excel's forecasting tools to support data-driven decision-making.

## Skills and Tools Demonstrated

This project focuses on the most widely used What-If Analysis tools in a business context:

*   **Financial Modeling:**
    *   Built a dynamic and interconnected profitability model from scratch, clearly separating user inputs (Price, Cost, etc.) from calculated outputs (Revenue, Profit).
    *   The model was designed to instantly recalculate the final profit based on any change to the input variables.

*   **What-If Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Goal Seek:** Mastered the use of Goal Seek to perform "reverse calculations." This was used to solve a critical business question: determining the exact break-even point by calculating the minimum number of units that must be sold to achieve zero profit.
    *   **Scenario Manager:** Expertly used the Scenario Manager to define, save, and compare multiple business scenarios (e.g., "Worst Case," "Best Case," "Most Likely Case").
    *   **Scenario Summary Reports:** Demonstrated the ability to generate a professional, presentation-ready summary report that automatically compares the inputs and final results of all defined scenarios, allowing for a clear understanding of the range of potential outcomes.

## Key Project Steps

1.  **Model Creation:** A core profitability model was built on the `Profit_Model` sheet, with clear inputs for price, cost, units sold, and marketing, and automated formulas for revenue, costs, and the final profit.
2.  **Break-Even Analysis (Part A):** **Goal Seek** was used to determine the exact number of units needed to be sold to bring the `TOTAL PROFIT / LOSS` to $0. This is a crucial first step in any product launch analysis.
3.  **Scenario Comparison (Part B):** **Scenario Manager** was used to create and save three distinct business scenarios: `Worst Case` (high costs, low sales), `Best Case` (low costs, high sales), and the `Most Likely Case` (based on the original model).
4.  **Summary Report Generation:** The Scenario Manager's "Summary" feature was used to generate a new, professionally formatted `Scenario Summary` sheet. This report provides a clear, side-by-side comparison of the profitability of each scenario and is the key deliverable of the analysis.

## Project Insights

*   The **Scenario Summary** clearly illustrates the range of potential business outcomes. The final profit could be as high as **$471,000** in the Best Case, but could also be as low as **$111,000** in the Worst Case, with the most likely outcome being **$260,000**.
*   This model provides a powerful yet straightforward tool for management to understand the financial risks and rewards associated with this product launch based on different market conditions.
