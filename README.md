# Excel Data Analysis Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my Excel Data Analysis Portfolio. This repository contains a collection of projects designed to showcase my proficiency in a wide range of data analysis techniques using Microsoft Excel. Each project demonstrates my ability to take raw data, clean it, perform insightful analysis, and present the findings in a clear and professional manner.

The projects progress from foundational skills like sorting and filtering to advanced topics such as interactive dashboarding, predictive modeling, and optimization.
